A couple of months later you get another offer from a different club in the region that isn't as good as the other offer, but it's still making your dream come true. You accept and this time you didn't have to abandon your family. You achieve many things throughout your career and are also able to pay off your parents' debts, you get married to your childhood friend who was also always there to support you, you have children and live happily ever after.
