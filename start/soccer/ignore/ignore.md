You decide to continue to juggle the ball despite your mom calling you to have dinner but by accident you break a window. Startled by the noise, your mom comes to see what happened. After seeing what you did, your mom is furious, and now you're grounded for a week.

During dinner, your mom lets your dad know about what you did, he is really angry. In addition to that, you notice he doesn't even have a plate, it's the 3rd time this week, you figure things must be going really bad. Now you feel guilty about disobeying your mom and breaking the window.

You (sobbing):"Mom, dad, I'm sorry. I promise I won't disobey you again, and if you happen to let me keep the soccer ball, I'll be very careful when playing  with it."
Mom (moved): "Hey, it's okay, just be more careful next time, alright?"

Next week you start playing soccer once again, and your dad sees your passion for it. You tell him that you want to become a professional, he is surprised but supports you. At night, you're wondering what your future is going to look like, you want to chase your dreams, but if that ever mean you're going to have to leave your family, what will you do?
