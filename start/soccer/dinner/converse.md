You decide to talk to your parents:

You: "Dad, I wanna be a professional soccer player,I love playing soccer and if I become professional I could give you and mom money ---so you don't have to skip dinner anymore!"

Dad: "Awww, I love the fact that you're thinking about me and your mom, but if you're going to do something I don't want it to be for me, or for your mom, I want you to do it because it's **your** dream."

Mom: "Yes, and don't forget we are very proud of you, no matter what you decide to become in the future.

You: Thank you mom, thank you dad, I love you both.

2 years later, you are playing for a well known soccer club and are one of the best players in the team. One day you get an offer to go to play soccer in another country, but you can't bring your family.
