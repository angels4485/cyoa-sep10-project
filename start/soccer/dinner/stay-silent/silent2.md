Your dad asks you what you did during the day, you tell him that you mostly watched some videos and did homework. Your dad asks you what videos you watched and you tell him that you watched soccer videos.

Dad:"You were watching soccer? That's new, maybe one day we should go to a soccer field to play for a little bit".

You: "YESSS, that'd be really fun"

Dad: "You know, when I was a kid I used to love soccer, there was this one player, his name is Messi. He used to be the best playing soccer, I always wanted to be like him."
You: "He was in one of the videos I watched, he is awesome! Now I also wanna be like him"

Later when you're trying to fall asleep, you wonder if you should've told your dad that you want to be a professional soccer player, maybe he is going to support you.
