You played really good and impressed coach morton, he put you into the starting lineup and sees lots of potential in you. He says that there is a game tommorow and that you better be ready. The day of the game comes and you already warmed up but you are very nervous since this is your first game ever. He puts you on and you play very well. One of the professional scouts approaches you and says if he can get your contact info because you made him very impressed. How do you respond?
